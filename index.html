<h2>About Me</h2>
<img src="assets/images/ProfilePic.jpg">

<p>My name is Vamsi Krishna Pappusetti and I graduated from Arizona State University in the May of 2017 with a useless liberal degree. The plan was to go to law school, but I have no intention now of taking out a $100,000-$200,000 loan to go get a degree that isn't really that marketable. So basically, I started coding in August and I really want to move toward a career in this.</p>
<p>I consider myself to be upbeat and enthuastic to learn! Outside of coding I enjoy engaging in political discussions, reading current events, and watching films & television.</p>
<p>I really want to be able to make my coding skills marketable as most of my other passions/hobbies are not. I like to be creative and make beautiful websites that people would be awed by. I really want to try and make this a full time job and I know that I would be good at it. I would like to try freelance, but I think it safer to actually work at a company in which I can get a salary. </p>
